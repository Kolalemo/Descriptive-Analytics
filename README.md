Re: Your next challenge, getting some quality knowledge from our data centre logs

Good morning,

Finally, I have some details for you!

Here are a few of the reports that senior management is wanting:
1)	A list of the devices involved in the data set.  Are they workstations or just Wi-Fi connections?
2)	A list of the usernames involved in the data set
3)	What is the profile (min, max, avg, etc) of time duration for workstations to start?
4)	What is the profile (min, max, avg, etc) of time duration for users to log in?  
5)	Can we determine if workstations need tech support from these times? (startup or shutdown fails? slow startup or shutdowns)?
6)	What is the profile (min, max, avg, etc) of user logged in durations?

When can you have these reports to me?  Senior Management would like them 24 hours from now?


Regards,


Senior IT Manager
